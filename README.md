# Build4'Āina

One part of the [Mauka2Makai Impact Challenge](https://purplemaia.org/mauka2makai/), Build4ʻĀina Hackathon was an event hosted by Purple Maiʻa on Oʻahu. Participants were invited to work on a KILO Dashboard, an innovative tool designed to seamlessly integrate kūpuna ʻike with modern technology for ahapuaʻa restoration.

# April 2025

Taking place across different wahi, this group started off at The Nation of Hawaiʻi to ground in the technology of Kilo, and connect with ʻāina stewards. Second day was at Hālau ʻĪnana in Moʻiliʻili, to plant hua and build out projects. And the last day was spent at the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, for demonstrations and presentations of our culminated work.
